We discuss architectures for three types of finite fields and their special versions popularly used in cryptography: binary fields, prime fields and extension fields. We summarize algorithms and hardware architectures for finite field multiplication, squaring, addition/subtraction, and inversion for each of these fields. Since implementations in hardware can either focus on high-speed or on area-time efficiency, a careful choice of the appropriate set of architectures has to be made depending on the performance requirements and available area.},

Both designs are extremely compact and can be implemented on any FPGA of PLD device. They were designed specifically for use as FPGA-based cryptographic hardware cores. The TRNG and PRNG were tested using the NIST and Diehard random number test suites.},

  abstract  = {It is shown that the amount of true randomness produced by the recently introduced Galois and Fibonacci ring oscillators can be evaluated experimentally by restarting the oscillators from the same initial conditions and by examining the time evolution of the standard deviation of the oscillating signals. The restart approach is also applied to classical ring oscillators and the results obtained demonstrate that the new oscillators can achieve orders of magnitude higher entropy rates. A theoretical explanation is also provided. The restart and continuous modes of operation and a novel sampling method almost doubling the entropy rate are proposed. Accordingly, the new oscillators appear to be by far more effective than other known solutions for random number generation with logic gates only.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a solution for the generation of true random numbers in a purely digital fashion; making it suitable for any FPGA type, because no FPGA vendor specific features (e.g., like phase-locked loop) or external analog components are required. Our solution is based on a framework for a provable secure true random number generator recently proposed by Sunar, Martin and Stinson. It uses a large amount of ring oscillators with identical ring lengths as a fast noise source - but with some deterministic bits - and eliminates the non-random samples by appropriate post-processing based on resilient functions. This results in a slower bit stream with high entropy. Our FPGA implementation achieves a random bit throughput of more than 2 Mbps, remains fairly compact (needing minimally 110 ring oscillators of 3 inverters) and is highly portable},

  abstract  = {The paper presents a novel and efficient method to generate true random numbers on FPGAs by inducing metastability in bi-stable circuit elements, e.g. flip-flops. Metastability is achieved by using precise programmable delay lines (PDL) that accurately equalize the signal arrival times to flip-flops. The PDLs are capable of adjusting signal propagation delays with resolutions higher than fractions of a pico second. In addition, a real time monitoring system is utilized to assure a high degree of randomness in the generated output bits, resilience against fluctuations in environmental conditions, as well as robustness against active adversarial attacks. The monitoring system employs a feedback loop that actively monitors the probability of output bits; as soon as any bias is observed in probabilities, it adjusts the delay through PDLs to return to the metastable operation region. Implementation on Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGAs and results of NIST randomness tests show the effectiveness of our approach.},
